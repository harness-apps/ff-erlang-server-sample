# Before you Begin

Harness Feature Flags (FF) is a feature management solution that enables users to change the softwareâ€™s functionality, without deploying new code. FF uses feature flags to hide code or behaviours without having to ship new versions of the software. A feature flag is like a powerful if statement.

This is a sample app demonstrating Erlang Server SDK integration with CF in an Erlang app.

## Requirements
- Erlang OTP 22 or newer.
- Rebar3


## To use this application, follow the steps as below ##

1) Create a project in Harness with Feature-flags module enabled
2) Create an environment within your project
3) Create a server-side sdk key in your environment **COPY the value from the Admin Console to your clipboard since this value will only be displayed once**
4) Create a boolean feature-flag in the admin console called `harnessappdemodarkmode`
5) Import the Erlang project in an IDE such as [IntelliJ](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/)

We are using the Erlang SDK as dependency for this sample program

Install dependencies using [Rebar3](https://rebar3.org/docs/basic_usage/#building)
```shell
rebar3 compile
````

In `config/sys.config` add your server-side sdk key from `step 3` above.
```Erlang
  {cfclient, [
    {api_key, {environment_variable, "FF_API_KEY_0"}},
  ]
}
```

Optional: to run [multiple instances of the SDK](https://github.com/harness/ff-erlang-server-sdk/blob/main/README.md#run-multiple-instances-of-the-sdk) for different projects you have on Harness, provide additional config for each additional instance:

```Erlang
# For more complex applications where you need to use multiple Harness projects, you can start up additional
# SDK instances for each project by defining the below config and adding each instance to one of your application supervisors (e.g. the root supervisor)

[
  {harness_project_1_config, [
    {cfclient, [
      {config, [
        {name, instance_name_1}
      ]},
      {api_key, {environment_variable, "FF_API_KEY_2"}}]
    }
  ]
},
  {harness_project_2_config, [
    {cfclient, [
      {config, [
        {name, instance_name_2}
      ]},
      {api_key, {environment_variable, "FF_API_KEY_2"}}]
    }
  ]
  },
  {cfclient, [
    {start_default_instance, true},
    {api_key, {environment_variable, "FF_API_KEY_0"}},
    {config, [
      {config_url, "https://config.ff.harness.io/api/1.0"},
      {events_url, "https://config.ff.harness.io/api/1.0"}
    ]},
    {analytics_push_interval, 60000}
  ]
}]
````
See `src/sampleapp_sup.erl` which adds the above instances to this application's root supervisor. 

Compile the application
```shell
rebar3 compile
```

Boot the application
```shell
rebar3 shell
```

Start the loop to print the flag value every 10 seconds
```shell
sample:
```
